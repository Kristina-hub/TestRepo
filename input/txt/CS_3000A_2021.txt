COURSE DESCRIPTION
In contrast to “traditional programming”, where a computer processes some output from a program
and data, machine learning uses data and output to produce a program which can be used to
characterize new data, inferring implicit patterns from said data to predict appropriate outputs. As a
computing paradigm, machine learning has been influential, with numerous applications: a computer
beating a world champion at Go; a digital assistant correctly recognizing and responding to your
queries; a self-driving car; a robot walking up a flight of stairs; early identification of tumours.
In this course we will explore the foundations of machine learning and relevant statistical methods.

4. Course Materials
Text Books (Recommended):
 The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman): [Free online]
 Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy) [Free online]
Students should check OWL (http://owl.uwo.ca) on a regular basis for news and updates. This is the
primary method by which information will be disseminated to all students in the class. Students are
responsible for checking OWL on a regular basis.
All course material will be posted to OWL: http://owl.uwo.ca.
If students need assistance, they can seek support on the OWL Help page. Alternatively, they can
contact the Western Technology Services Helpdesk. They can be contacted by phone at 519-661-3800
or ext. 83800.
Technical Requirements
A computer for completion of course assessments (i.e. assignments, midterm, final exam).
5. Methods of Evaluation
The overall course grade will be calculated as listed below:
Undergraduate
Assignments 40 %
Midterm Exam 25 %
Final Exam 35 %
Graduate
Assignments 40 %
Midterm Exam 25 %
Final Project 35 %
Assignment due dates (tentative):
Assignment 1 – September 23rd @ 11:59 PM EST
Assignment 2 – September 30th @ 11:59 PM EST
Assignment 3 – October 14th @ 11:59 PM EST
Assignment 4 – October 21st @ 11:59 PM EST
Assignment 5 – November 18th @ 11:59 PM EST
Assignment 6 – November 25th @ 11:59 PM EST
The lowest assignment mark will be dropped; because of this, no accommodations for late or missed
assignments will be given. Late assignments will not be graded.
Midterm:
The midterm will be held on Thursday, October 28th from 2:30 to 4:30 PM EST in NCB 113. The midterm
will cover all lecture materials up to that point (i.e. all content from Week 1 to Week 6).
Accommodated Evaluations
If you are unable to meet a course requirement due to illness or other serious circumstances, you must
seek approval for the absence as soon as possible. Approval can be granted either through a selfreporting
of absence or via the Dean’s Office/Academic Counselling unit of your Home Faculty. If you
are a Science student, the Academic Counselling Office of the Faculty of Science is located in NCB 280,
and can be contacted at scibmsac@uwo.ca.
For further information, please consult the university’s policy on academic consideration for student
absences:

6. Accommodation and Accessibility
Accommodation Policies
Students with disabilities work with Accessible Education (formerly SSD) which provides
recommendations for accommodation based on medical documentation or psychological and
cognitive testing. The Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities policy can be found at:
https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/Academic Accommodation_disabilities.pdf
Academic Consideration for Student Absence
Students will have up to two (2) opportunities during the regular academic year to use an on-line portal
to self-report an absence during the semester, provided the following conditions are met: the absence
is no more than 48 hours in duration, and the assessment for which consideration is being sought is
worth 30% or less of the student’s final grade. Students are expected to contact their instructors within
24 hours of the end of the period of the self-reported absence, unless noted on the syllabus. Students
are not able to use the self-reporting option in the following circumstances:
 for exams scheduled by the Office of the Registrar (e.g., December and April exams)
 absence of a duration greater than 48 hours,
 assessments worth more than 30% of the student’s final grade,
 if a student has already used the self-reporting portal twice during the academic year
If the conditions for a Self-Reported Absence are not met, students will need to provide a Student
Medical Certificate if the absence is medical, or provide appropriate documentation if there are
compassionate grounds for the absence in question. Students are encouraged to contact their Faculty
academic counselling office to obtain more information about the relevant documentation.
Students should also note that individual instructors are not permitted to receive documentation
directly from a student, whether in support of an application for consideration on medical grounds, or
for other reasons. All documentation required for absences that are not covered by the Self-Reported
Absence Policy must be submitted to the Academic Counselling office of a student's Home Faculty.
For policy on Academic Consideration for Student Absences - Undergraduate Students in First Entry
Programs, see:
https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/Academic_Consideration_for_absences.pdf
and for the Student Medical Certificate (SMC), see:
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/medicalform.pdf
Religious Accommodation
Students should consult the University's list of recognized religious holidays, and should give
reasonable notice in writing, prior to the holiday, to the Instructor and an Academic Counsellor if their
course requirements will be affected by a religious observance. Additional information is given in the
Western Multicultural Calendar:
https://multiculturalcalendar.com/ecal/index.php?s=c-univwo
You may also be eligible to write the Special Exam if you are in a “Multiple Exam Situation” (see
http://www.registrar.uwo.ca/examinations/exam_schedule.html).
If a student fails to write a scheduled Special Examination, the date of the next Special Examination (if
granted) normally will be the scheduled date for the final exam the next time this course is offered. The
maximum course load for that term will be reduced by the credit of the course(s) for which the final
examination has been deferred. See Academic Calendar for details (under Special Examinations).
7. Academic Policies
The website for Registrarial Services is http://www.registrar.uwo.ca.
In accordance with policy, http://www.uwo.ca/its/identity/activatenonstudent.html, the centrally
administered e-mail account provided to students will be considered the individual’s official university
e-mail address. It is the responsibility of the account holder to ensure that e-mail received from the
University at his/her official university address is attended to in a timely manner.
Contingency plan for an in-person class pivoting to 100% online learning
In the event of a COVID-19 resurgence during the course that necessitates the course delivery moving
away from face-to-face interaction, all remaining course content will be delivered entirely online,
either synchronously (i.e., at the times indicated in the timetable) or asynchronously (e.g., posted on
OWL for students to view at their convenience). The grading scheme will not change. Any remaining
assessments will also be conducted online as determined by the course instructor.
Scholastic offences are taken seriously and students are directed to read the appropriate policy,
specifically, the definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site:
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf.
All required papers may be subject to submission for textual similarity review to the commercial
plagiarism detection software under license to the University for the detection of plagiarism. All papers
submitted for such checking will be included as source documents in the reference database for the
purpose of detecting plagiarism of papers subsequently submitted to the system. Use of the service is
subject to the licensing agreement, currently between The University of Western Ontario and
Turnitin.com (http://www.turnitin.com).
